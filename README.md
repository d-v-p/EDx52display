# EDx52display
Reading Elite: Dangerous journal information and displaying on a Logitech X52 PRO MFD via [my JSON-based driver](https://github.com/peterbn/X52-pro-MFD-JSON-Driver).

This project owes a great deal to [Anthony Zaprzalka](https://github.com/AZaps) in terms of idea and execution
and to [Jonathan Harris](https://github.com/Marginal) and the [EDMarketConnector](https://github.com/Marginal/EDMarketConnector) project 
for the CSV files of names for all the commodities.

## Installation
Unzip the release folder and run the `EDx52display.exe` application.

## Troubleshooting
This application reads the journal files of your elite dangerous installation.
These are normally located in `%USERPROFILE%\\Saved Games\\Frontier Developments\\Elite Dangerous` on Windows. However, if your installation
uses a different location, you should update the conf.yaml file in the installation folder.
